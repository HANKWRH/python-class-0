	when i killed 5 enemey i will win the game
Lose:
	When i am touched by enemey i will lose health
	when my health become zero i will lose

About my game:
	i use 2.5D to make this game.
	What is 2.5D?
	2.5D is almost like 3D but all the object is still 2D
	and i change the scale of the object to let them look
	like they are moving back and foward

Discussion:
